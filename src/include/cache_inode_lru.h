 * @brief Constant-time cache inode cache management implementation
 *
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This module implements a constant-time cache management strategy
 * based on LRU.  Some ideas are taken from 2Q [Johnson and Shasha 1994]
 * and MQ [Zhou, Chen, Li 2004].  In this system, cache management does
 * interact with cache entry lifecycle.  Also, the cache size high- and
 * low- water mark management is maintained, but executes asynchronously
 * to avoid inline request delay.  Cache management operations execute in
 * constant time, as expected with LRU (and MQ).
 *
 * Cache entries in use by a currently-active protocol request (or other
 * operation) have a positive refcount, and threfore should not be present
 * at the cold end of an lru queue if the cache is well-sized.
 *
 * Cache entries with lock and open state are not eligible for collection
 * under ordinary circumstances, so are kept on a separate lru_pinned
 * list to retain constant time.
 *
